# 3D Vision: Deep Direct Sparse-to-Dense Localization

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Project description:
Visual localization is a key component of many robotics systems. However, in changing conditions such as day-night or summer-winter, it could be very challenging. 
In this project, we push the state-of-the-art in visual localization by building a pipeline which estimates the 6DOF pose of the camera given a query image and a 3D scene. 
To do this, we (1) perform feature-metric PnP given the initial estimation of the pose and the dense features of images, 
(2) train the encoder of Sparse-to-Dense Hypercolumn Matching (S2DHM) method on the supervision of pixel correspondences to generate feature maps and 
(3) integrate feature-metric PnP and learned encoder into the S2DHM framework to construct a visual localization pipeline.

### 1.2 Data root
You need to follow directory structure of the `data` as below.
```

### 1.3 Usage:

Run the following commands to install this repository and the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zimengjiang/gn_net.git
cd gn_net/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
This code was run and tested on Python 3.7.3, using Pytorch 1.5.1 although it should be compatible with some previous versions. You can follow instructions to install Pytorch [here](https://pytorch.org/). *Please configure the data root and save root before training! You can change the parameters in **run.py**.*
The **vgg_checkpoint** is the original weight provided by S2DHM. You can download the checkpoint files from [here](https://github.com/germain-hug/S2DHM/tree/master/checkpoints). And please remember to set up the path to **vgg_checkpoint** in **run.py**.


```
python run.py
```
